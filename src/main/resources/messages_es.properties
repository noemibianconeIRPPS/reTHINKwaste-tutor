At the end of the self-assessment you will receive a tailored summary of the characteristics of your area, along with some suggestions for next steps and dedicated supplementary materials. Once registered on the platform, you can go through each module separately, and return later to complete the full process of self-assessment.
login.paytHover = Pay As You Throw (PAYT) is a usage-pricing model for disposing of municipal solid waste. Users are charged a rate based on how much waste they present for collection to the municipality or local authority. A variety of models exist depending on the region and municipality. Waste can be measured by weight or size, or by unit counts, identified using different types of bags, tags, containers or even RFID. Whatever the case, PAYT requires intensive technology, sensor deployment (RFID transponders, intelligent containers etc.) and big data analysis with all associated costs. But simultaneously waste producers? responsibilities must be raised with smart approaches based on social science.
login.kaytHover =  Know As You Throw (KAYT) is a concept that often goes hand in hand with PAYT and accompanies PAYT schemes? implementation by using simple and effective individual communication tools.  If KAYT is ignored, the risk is to spend a lot in technology forgetting how to deliver constant and positive feedback to citizens or not providing enabling actions to make the users aware of their waste prevention and sorting performances.

#TTR
ttr.title = TTR Module
ttr.extendedTTRModuleUppercase = TECHNOLOGICAL AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS MODULE
ttr.moduleIntro = Direct, customised and constant communication with the users (KAYT) and dynamic and progressive tariffs based on the delivery of undifferentiated waste (PAYT) are effective tools for increasing separate collection. However, it is essential to be prepared and to use the technology properly! The following tool guides the decision-makers with questions in specific fields: data management, precise measurement of the amount of waste collected, access management to the recycling centre, communication tools and information on the tariff. At the end of the process, the user will receive feedback on suitability of the facilities at hand, as well as suggestions on how to achieve the target and implement the PAYT and KAYT approaches in own community.

#MNC Page
mnc.title = MNC Module
mnc.extendedMNCModuleUppercase = MANAGEMENT AND NORMATIVE CRITERIA MODULE
mnc.introText = Management and normative framework condition are a prerequisite for the introduction of PAYT "Pay As You Throw" schemes. Most of the times municipalities are not prepared to introduce it as the legislative framework don?t make it viable to implement it easily, or the internal management staff is not prepared. Sometimes, a waste tax still doesn?t even exist, so there are relevant preliminary steps to be taken. This module of the LIFE RethinkWaste toolkit aims at guiding policy makers at local level through basic questions about the normative and internal management prerequisites prior to the introduction of PAYT.

#OBP Page
obp.title = OBP Module
obp.extendedOBPModuleUppercase = OPTIMAL BUSINESS PLAN MODULE
obp.introText = The definition of the business plan is a key moment in the process of designing a PAYT system, possibly integrated with direct, personalised and constant communication with users (Know-as-you-throw, KAYT). This tool allows the decision makers to evaluate several elements necessary for the preparation of its business plan, including economies of scale, the possible impacts on costs and tariffs, etc. At the end of the process, the user will receive feedback on the adequacy of the economic resources available to him in relation to the various factors considered and some suggestions on possible technical options for implementing a PAYT and/or a KAYT system in his territory.

#PM Page
pm.title = PM Module
pm.extendedPMModuleUppercase = PRIVACY MANAGEMENT MODULE

pm.guidelineUppercase = GUIDELINE
pm.introText = Managing municipal waste is a competence attributed by law to local authorities. That's the reason why they are competent to decide about the model of waste management to be implemented in their territory, including those that allow identification of users (mainly door to door and closed containers with user identification). Processing of personal data implying identification of users is covered by article 6.1 of the GDPR, and the applicable clause may vary depending on the country.

#ARM PAGE
arm.title = ARM Module
arm.extendedARMModuleUppercase = AWARENESS RAISING MEASURES
arm.moduleInfoUppercase = MODULE INFO
arm.guidelineUppercase = GUIDELINE
arm.introText = Progressive Municipal Solid Waste tariff systems are based on the PAYT (Pay As You Throw) model. The PAYT model is based on the principle that those who generate larger quantities of unsorted waste, than fractions sent for recycling, pay a higher tax. It serves to ensure a fairer redistribution of the waste tax in favour of virtuous users. This model can be integrated with the KAYT (Know As You Throw) model. The KAYT model is based on the principle that greater information and knowledge of waste and its disposal leads to a considerable improvement in separate waste collection. When fully operational, it can guarantee a maximization of differentiated collection levels but also a clear improvement both in terms of waste quality and a reduction in the production of waste per capita. Improving separate waste collection through the integrated system between the PAYT and KAYT models can have important repercussions in waste management and in the transition to the circular economy. It is essential to maximize the % of separate waste collection to reach at least 65%. It becomes fundamental to raise user awareness through targeted and periodic campaigns. It is therefore essential to ensure continuous monitoring of user performance, measuring the quantity and quality of waste conferred by individual users and modulating awareness raising actions based on the corrective measures to be put in place.

#IGPP
igpp.title = IGPP Module
igpp.extendedIGPPModuleUppercase = INTEGRATION OF GREEN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT IN CONTRACTING WASTE UTILITIES
igpp.moduleIntro = The PAYT and KAYT approaches cannot be implemented stand-alone; a correct strategy should integrate a wider overview, in order to shift the whole waste management service into a more sustainable level. Green and Circular Public Procurement (GPP and CPP) is recognized at EU-level as key leverage for the transition to more sustainable production and consumption patterns. The following tool guides the decision-makers with questions, investigating organisational and training aspects of the procurement staff, as well as the actual implementation of environmental criteria in the waste management service tenders. At the end of the process, the user will receive feedback on readiness and awareness respect to GPP and CPP implementation at organisational level. Moreover, some suggestion how to achieve better results are provided.
